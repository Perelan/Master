	abstract = {Because of the increase in easily obtainable internet-connected mobile devices and their unique characteristics, choosing the proper data serialization format has become increasingly difficult. These devices are resource scarce and bandwidth limited. In this paper, we compare four different data serialization formats with an emphasis on serialization speed, data size, and usability. The selected serialization formats include {XML}, {JSON}, Thrift, and {ProtoBuf}. {XML} and {JSON} are the most well known text-based data formats, while {ProtoBuf} and Thrift are relatively new binary serialization formats. These data serialization formats are tested on an Android device using both text-heavy and number-heavy objects.},
