\subsection{Stakeholders}
McGrath and Whitty \cite{stakeholderdefined} describe the term stakeholder as those persons or organizations that have, or claim an interest in the project. They distinguish stakeholders into four categories: 1) \textit{contributing (primary) stakeholders} participate in developing and sustaining the project; 2) \textit{observer (secondary) stakeholders} affect or influence the project;  3) \textit{end-users (tertiary stakeholder)} interact and uses the output of the application; and 4) \textit{invested stakeholders} has control of the project. In Nidra, there are three stakeholders who affect the application, and each can be categorized respectfully:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|Patients| - are identified as an end-user; they interact with the application.  
    \item \verb|Researchers/Doctors| - are identified as an observer stakeholder; they might not use the application itself; however, they might use the data obtained from the patients' recordings for further analysis. Also, request functionality in the application.
    \item \verb|Developers| - are identified as a contributor stakeholder; they maintain the application from bugs or extend the functionally of the application. Additionally, they can contribute to developing modules that extend the functionality of the application. 
\end{itemize}
