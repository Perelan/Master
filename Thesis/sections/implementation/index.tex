\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter starts with a brief overview of application components for the three individual applications (i.e., Nidra, data streams dispatching module, and flow sensor wrapper), alongside a description of the applications. Moreover, the implementation of the separate concerns identified in the previous chapter as an Android application called \textit{Nidra}.

In this thesis, we operate with three individual applications: Nidra, data streams dispatching module, and the sensor wrapper for the Flow sensor. Figure \ref{fig:app_components} illustrates the Android components (i.e., activity, service, and broadcast receiver) for each application, which run in a separate process on the user's mobile device. The subsequent sections present a brief overview of the applications structure and components.


\subsection{Flow Sensor Wrapper}\label{imp:flowsensor}
As part of the thesis, the goal is to integrate the support for the Flow sensor. We developed a sensor wrapper that connects with the sensor source by using the BlueTooth LE protocol. To create a sensor wrapper, we followed the instructions provided by Gj√∏by \cite{gjoby} in order to create a new driver application that connects with the data streams dispatching module (DSDM). Below, a brief overview of the main components of the driver is discussed.

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
    \item[WrapperService:] Is instantiated by the DSDM during the sensor discovery phase (described in Section \ref{imp:dsdm}). This component is responsible for handling starting and stopping of the data acquisition (event sent as broadcasts from DSDM), as well as establish an IPC connection using a binder with the DSDM application. 
    \item[CommunicationHandler:] Upon IPC connection with the DSDM and a request to start data collection, a separate thread of this component is created for interacting with the component that is responsible for integration of the Flow sensor (described in Section \ref{imp:comflow}). This component is mainly responsible for forwarding the data acquired from the sensor to the \verb|DataHandler| component. 
    \item[DataHandler:] Preprocesses the collected data from the Flow source into a data packet before forwarding the packet to the DSDM application. Part of this process is to construct the data packet correctly. The data packet is formatted as JSON string and contains the id (Flow) of the sensor wrapper, the current date and time, and the data points from the sensor source. The data packet is then sent, using the established binder connection, to the DSDM application.
\end{description}

Besides the components which manage the connectivity, collection, and disconnection of the Flow sensor with the DSDM, two activities are responsible for providing an interface to select the Flow sensor and display the state of the Flow sensor on the user's screen:
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
    \item[MainActivity:] Presents the state and information of the selected Flow sensor on the user's screen. Currently, it presents the connectivity state (connected or disconnected), the battery level of the sensor, the MAC address and the firmware level, as well as the option to remove or connect to another sensor source. 
    \item[DeviceListActivity:] Available devices or sensors that are in range for BlueTooth connectivity with the mobile device is presented to the user. The user has to select the correct  Flow sensor that will be used for data acquisition.  As a feature, the Flow sensor has a distinguishable icon to make it easier to select the correct sensor source amongst other devices or sensors that is in range of the user's mobile device.
\end{description}
The Flow sensor wrapper stores the name and the MAC address of the selected Flow sensor in a \verb|SharedPreference|. As such, the user has to configure the sensor wrapper once, and the information remains persistent in the application.

The preceding components are a part of the driver to connect with the data streams dispatching module. However, the communication with the sensor source is not a part of these components. The communication with the Flow sensor occurs over BlueTooth LE (BLE) protocol which is designed to provide lower power consumption on data transmission, and sensors that utilize BLE is designed to last for a more extended period. In order to connect with BLE sensors, we can use the API's provided by Android. The implementation of the API's is introduced as a new component (\textit{BluetoothHandler}), which solely communicates with the Flow sensor over BLE. Below, a brief overview of how to establish a connection and interpret the collected data from the Flow sensor through BLE in Android is described. However, a more detailed description of implementation can be found in Appendix D.


\subsubsection{Communicating with the Flow Sensor}\label{imp:comflow}
In order to communicate with the Flow sensor, we have to use the BlueTooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. To begin with, the user has to select the desired Flow sensor to use for collecting the data. As such, when the command of starting the collection is passed to the \verb|StartReceiver| broadcast receiver which is handled by \verb|WrapperService|, a separate thread of \verb|CommunicationHandler| is created. This thread, start the service of \verb|BluetoothHandler| and initializes the connection to the selected Flow sensor based on the MAC address of the sensor. 

The \verb|BluetoothHandler| is the component we introduce, which manages the connection to the Flow sensor, discovers services provided by the sensor, and manages the decoding of the data received from the sensor. This component acts as a GATT client which connects with a GATT server. The GATT server in our case is the Flow sensor, which provides a service that encompasses several characterstics that contains values and descriptors. In BlueTooth, the objects (e.g., services and characteristics) are identified by a universally unique identifier (UUID)\footnote{A standardized 128-bit format for string ID to uniquely identify information}, and there is a collection of assigned numbers to standard objects \cite{uuid}. The UUID for GATT attributes for BLE accordingly to BlueTooth is structured as following \textit{PREFIX-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb}, where the prefix is the assigned number that categorizes an individual object. The most interesting characteristics to us, are the manufacturer name (prefix: 0x2A29), firmware revision (prefix: 0x2A26), battery level (prefix:0x2A19) and flow (breathing) measures (prefix: 0xFFB3). The latter characteristic prefix is not a part of the standard; however, the manufacturer defined prefix. Also, it is of most interest to us as it contains the values for the breathing data. 

To receive flow (breathing) data and the battery level from the sensor source, we have to enable it by notifying the GATT server. This is performed by specifying the service and the underlying characteristics we want the values from. For example, to enable flow (breathing) data, we specify the service (prefix: OxFFB0) and characteristic (prefix: 0xFFB3), and send it with the API provided by Android.  As such, we enable the Flow sensor to collect breathing data. 

The Flow sensor gatherers data at a frequency of 10 Hz; however, the data from the sensor is sent to the connected devices on approximately 1.5 Hz. Which means each data received from the sensor contains 5-7 data points with a timestamp of acquisition. We proceed to smooth out the data points by averaging the values, which statistically is to filter out misfits of values and to find an estimate of value on a given time. The data is sent to the \verb|CommunicationHandler| which further sends it to the \verb|DataHandler|. The \verb|DataHandler| creates a data packet with the data as a JSON string, and sends the data packet on the binder (created in the \verb|WrapperService|) between the sensor wrapper and DSDM on the method \verb|PutJson()| (described in Section \ref{implement:aidl}). 

When the command of stopping the collection is passed to \verb|StopReceiving| broadcast receiver, the \verb|CommunicationHandler| thread is interrupted. The interruption closes and unbinds the connection with the \verb|BluetoothHandler|. Within the \verb|BluetoothHandler| the connectivity with the GATT server (sensor) is disconnected and closed. Finally, the screen presented to the user shows that the sensor has disconnected.

To summarize, the \verb|BluetoothHandler| connects with the selected Flow sensor with the BlueTooth LE protocol by using the API's provided by Android. By specifying the appropriate service and characteristic we can obtain breathing data from the sensor. The sensor collects data at a frequency of 10 Hz; however, sends a small burst of data with 5-7 data points for a timestamp at a frequency of 1.5 Hz. Moreover, we procced to smooth out the data points by calculating the average value. The data is then sent to the \verb|CommunicationHandler| which further sends it to the \verb|DataHandler|. The \verb|DataHandler| creates a data packet of value including metadata, and forwards the data packet to the data streams dispatching module.  


\subsection{Data Streams Dispatching Module}\label{imp:dsdm}
The data streams dispatching module developed by Bugajski \cite{daniel} provides an interface for application instances to subscribe to data packets from supported and available sensor sources. The modularity this application provides towards managing and supporting various sensor source allows for faster development time. Also, it provides a common interface for communication with sensor sources that have different Link Layer technology (e.g., BlueTooth) and low-level communcation protocols (e.g., vensors that provides sensor spesific SDK). 

This application discovers available sensor wrappers installed on the user's mobile device, establishes connection with the sensor source on requests, and forwards data packets from the sensors to the subscribed applications (all in the \verb|DataStreamDispatchingService| component). Below, we briefly introduce the components and their mechanism in the application.

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
    \item[Sensor Discovery] The initial design of discovery for installed sensor wrappers was performed by sending a broadcast with an action of \textit{HELLO} as an intent. All sensor wrappers are designed to respond to this action with their package name as \textit{id} and the name of the sensor wrapper as \textit{name}. This application is then aware of which sensor wrappers that are available on the mobile device. 
    
    However, during the development of this thesis, Android had limited the use of implicit broadcasts on newer Android versions \cite{broadcasterror}. Implicit broadcasts are those broadcast that does not target a specific application; however, sends out an action with a message and those application that filters and listens for the actions can handle this message accordingly. To overcome this, a re-design of the sensor discovery was made. Instead of DSDM ever so often sends out a HELLO broadcast, the sensor wrapper sends out an explicit broadcast directed to the DSDM to make it aware of its existence. The broadcast is sent to the \textit{SensorDiscovery} directed explicitly to DSDM broadcast receivers, encapsulated with the name and the package name of the sensor wrapper. The DSDM stores the sensor wrapper information in a \verb|SharedPreference|, which will be used locate the sensor wrapper based on the request from the subscribing applications.

    \item[DataStreamDispatchingService] Encompasses most of the functionality of the application. This component acts as a data distributor between applications that desire to connect with sensor sources, and sensor sources forward their data packets to this service. Also, this component ensures to duplicate and make identical data packets to all subscribed applications. The actions that are exposed to the sensor wrapper and the subscribed applications are managed within this component by providing an interface with a binder for IPC communication (see Section \ref{implement:aidl}). 

\end{description}


To summarize, this application acts as a data distributor for supported sensor sources. Subscribing applications can select a desired sensor source (e.g., Flow) for data acquisition. The data received from the sensor source are obtained in the sensor wrapper and sent to this application as data packets. This application duplicate the data packets to those applications that subscribe to the sensor source and send it to the them accordingly. 


\subsection{Nidra}
In this thesis, we focus on creating an interface that can record, share, and analyze breathing data of a patient over an extended period using the Flow sensor. In order to provide an interface, we developed an Android application called Nidra. This section describes the components that Nidra constitute of, while in Section \ref{impl:ioc} we discuss the implementation of Nidra. Below, we describe the main components of the application:
 
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
    \item[MainActivity:] Encompasses most of the functionality in the application, besides recording, by using fragments as a modular approach to seperate functionality. The fragments lie on top of this host activity, and a transition amongst the fragments is triggered based on user interactions. 
    \item[RecordingActivity:] This activity manages the recording part of the application by invoking the \verb|RecordingFragment|. However, the fragment handles the connectivity with the data streams dispatching module, handles the data packets from the sensor sources, and assuring for reconnecting with the sensor on human disruptions and sensor disconnections. Also, it manages the interactions that can be performed on the recording screen (e.g., real-time graph).
    \item[LandingActivity:] When launching the application for the first time, a screen with an introduction to the application is shown to the user. Further, the user is prompted to type in biometrical data (e.g., name, gender, age, height, weight), which will be used to enrich the recording of the patient. 
\end{description}

Moreover, Nidra leverages the functionality that the data streams dispatching module provides. To use the functionality, the recording activity connects with the data streams dispatching module, and the reference that will be used to receive data packets are sent to the service of \textit{DSDService}. This service implements the interface provided by the data streams dispatching module, and the data obtained within this service are directly sent to the \verb|RecordingActivity| for processing. 


To summarize, the components discussed in this section constitute an application that enables recording, sharing, and analysis of breathing data obtained from the Flow sensor. Further, we elaborate on the actions and functionality of Nidra in Section \ref{impl:ioc}.  


\subsection{Inter-Process Communication}\label{implement:aidl}
In order to communicate with between the applications, such as remote procedure calls (RPC) to application components that run remotely, we can use the IPC mechanisms. In Android there are two viable mechanisms to enable IPC: (1) \verb|Binder| enables a process to invoke functions in another process remotely; and (2) \verb|Intent| a message passing interface allowing applications to send messages to each other. In this section we describe how these mechanisms are used in Nidra.

The Intent mechanism is mainly used for sharing bundles of primitive data types (e.g., strings or floats) across activities and applications, as long as the reference (e.g., package name) is valid. Another possibility of using intent is during broadcasts within the application or to other application. In Nidra, \verb|Intent|'s are used to start activites, share data between components with local broadcasts, as well as when launching a module (discussed in Section \ref{impl:ioc}).

To implement the binder mechanism, we can use design of the data streams dispatching modules which use Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL). In order to communicate with processes, the data objects have to be decomposed into primitives that the operating system can understand. AIDL provides this mechanism by providing a programming interface that both the client and the service agree upon. The AIDL interface is defined in an \verb|.AIDL| file, and located in the \verb|src/| directory of the hosting service application (DSDM), likewise, for other applications that bind to the hosting service (Nidra and sensor wrappers). It is essential to have identical \verb|.AIDL| files across the applications, otherwise the system will not recognize it as the same interface. In Listing 5.1, the interface is based on the functionality of the hosting service application provides (DSDM). 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={An interface provided by the host service (i.e., DSDM) that provides functionality other applications can use (e.g., Nidra and sensor wrappers)}, captionpos=b]
// MainServiceConnection.aidl
package com.sensordroid;

interface MainServiceConnection {
    void putJson(in String json);
    int Subscribe(String capabilityId, int frequency, String componentPackageName, String componentClassName);
    int Unsubscribe(String capabilityId, String componentClassName);
    String Publish(String capabilityId, String type, String metric, String description);
    void Unpublish(String capabilityId, String key);
    List<String> getPublishers();
}
\end{lstlisting}

In Nidra, some of the functionality is utilized to enable recording. More specifically, \verb|getPubishers()| method is used to get all of the sensors publishers (e.g., Flow sensor), the \verb|Subscribe()| and \verb|Unsubscribe()| is used in order to subscribe and unsubscribe to a specific sensor publisher, and the data that is forwarded from by the sensor publisher sent to the \verb|putJson()| method.

As for the Flow sensor wrapper, uses the same interface to communicate with the data streams dispatching module. However, the only method call is towards \verb|putJson()| when forwarding its data packets. The data streams dispatching module is aware of which type of connectivity (e.g., publisher or subscriber) that forwards the data, therefore, the call by the sensor wrapper is processed as data packets that will be sent to the subscribing applications. 

\section{Implementation of Concerns} \label{impl:ioc}
In the design chapter of this thesis, we conceptualized the tasks by decomposing them into separate concerns and discussing design choices for implementation. This section realizes the discussion by implementing the concerns in Android and developing the application Nidra. For each concern, we illustrate the components and objects that interact with each other, step-by-step; the legend for the figures are shown in \Cref{fig:legend}.

\section{Miscellaneous}

\subsection{Collecting Data Over a Longer Period}
In Android, applications which are idle in the background or not visible to the user can be killed in order to reclaim resources for other applications or preserve battery time. However, this mechanism is not viable for collecting data over an extended time, because it can kill our applications during recording. To overcome this, there are several methods to prevent the Android system from killing our applications, which is presented in the subsequent sections.

\subsubsection{Keep the CPU Alive}
The Android system provides a wake lock mechanism to keep the CPU running in order to complete work. As long as we keep the CPU alive, we can collect the data over an extended period. Any applications can utilize wake-locks in their application; albeit, the documentation states that holding onto a wake lock for a longer period, shortens the device's battery time. Therefore, it is crucial to release the lock when the recording has terminated. Also, to use wake-locks the permission has to be added in the application's manifest file (see: Section \ref{impl:manifest}). Nidra utilizes the wake lock when the recording has started (inside of the \verb|RecordingFragment|) and are seen in following listing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={}, captionpos=b]
powerManager = (PowerManager) mContext.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE);
wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK,
        "CESAR::collection");

wakeLock.acquire();
\end{lstlisting}
The lock is released when the activity is destroyed by terminating the recording process.


\subsubsection{Priority}
Process's lifecycle is not directly related with the host application; however, determined by the system which detects parts of applications that are running, how important they are to the user, and how much memory is available in the system. A process can be killed by the system to reclaim memory for other processes to take its place. However, there are specific measures to prolong the services run time. That is, to increase the process importance in the "process-hierarchy". By assigning a process to be a \textit{foreground process}, we can, for most cases, prevent the system from killing a process. In our case, the \verb|DSDService| which receives data packets from the data streams dispatching module. In the following listing, the code snippet for creating a foreground process is presented.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={}, captionpos=b]
public void toForeground() {
    NotificationManager notificationManager = 
        (NotificationManager) this.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
    NotificationCompat.Builder builder = null;
    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
        int importance = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT;
        NotificationChannel notificationChannel = new NotificationChannel("ID", "Name", importance);
        notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(notificationChannel);
        builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, notificationChannel.getId());
    } else {
        builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this);
    }

    builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_info_black_24dp);
    builder.setContentTitle("Nidra");
    builder.setTicker("Recording");
    builder.setContentText("Recording data");

    Intent i = new Intent(this, DSDService.class);
    i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);
    PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, i, 0);
    builder.setContentIntent(pi);

    final Notification note = builder.build();

    startForeground(android.os.Process.myPid(), note);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Android Manifest} \label{impl:manifest}
The Android Manifest describes the essential information about our application, such as the application components, permissions, and the package name. The application is constituted by application components, and each component contains metadata describing the application component. Below, we describe the some of permissions and a few application components of Nidra and the Flow sensor wrapper.

\subsubsection{Nidra}

The Nidra manifest file constitutes of three activities, one service, and one provider. The latter is used to share a record between applications. Providers enable other applications to access a file or data from Nidra. With the provider, a direct URI link obtained by the provider grants a more secure sharing of data between application. In the listing below, the attribute \verb|authorities| is the name that identifies the data offered by the provider (often distinguished by package name and postfix of "provider"). Also, the meta-data with the resource contains information with the path to the file in the respective application directory.  

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={}, captionpos=b]
<provider
    android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" />
</provider>
\end{lstlisting}

The permissions for Nidra are presented in the listing below, which includes the wake lock permissions, and the permissions to store data in external storage and the internal storage. The storage permissions are required in order to use the \verb|SharedPreference| method for storing, as well as the storage of files that will be accessed by other applications (during sharing of records).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={}, captionpos=b]
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_INTERNAL_STORAGE" />
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Flow Sensor Wrapper}

As for the Flow sensor wrapper, the application components structure are based on the driver created by Gj√∏by \cite{gjoby}. With an expectation of the activities and the BlueTooth service. In the listing below, the permissions of the application are shown. In order to leverage the Bluetooth LE protocol, we need the permissions of \textit{BLUETOOTH}, \textit{BLUETOOTH\_ADMIN}, \textit{ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION}. The latter permission is obligatory because it is used to list the available sensor source in the area. Without permission, Android does not present any list of available sensor sources. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={}, captionpos=b]
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
[...]
\end{lstlisting}
