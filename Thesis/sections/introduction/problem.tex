\section{Problem Statement}

As indicated in the background and motivation section, we decided to look into there are opportunity of extending the system even further. The market has new and affordable sensors that can aid with the data acquisition, which we seamlessly can integrate with the extensible data acquisition tool. In the end, we can hopefully strengthen the detection of abnormal sleeping patterns, and decreasing the risk of the symptoms they may endure.

In this thesis, we will continue to build on the project by implementing the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Integrate new a sensor wrapper}\\The following section Flow Sensor Kit introduces to a new sensor type to be used in the CESAR project. Thus, creating a new wrapper to integrate it in the system is necessary. By utilizing the library that comes with the sensor, we can integrate that with the interface and protocol of the CESAR project.
    \item \textit{Visualization of the activities on an Android device}\\Designing, architecting, and modulating an Android application that implements the new sensor data in an adequately layout.
    \item \textit{Detecting anomalies with the help of Machine Learning}\\Classifying the data so we can detect abnormal sleeping patterns, and hopefully training an model that can detect the sleeping patterns, locally on the device, without any external supervisor (human intervention) analyzing the data. 
\end{enumerate}
