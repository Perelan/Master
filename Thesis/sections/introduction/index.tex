\section{Limitations}
Based on the goals and requirements stated in previous section, the scope of this thesis is to design and implement an application capable of recording breathing data obtained by the Flow sensor kit over an extended period. 

We limite the scope to integrating the support for the Flow sensor kit in Nidra, and exluded to test for already integrated sensor sources (e.g., Bitalino). Further, with the Flow sensor kit provided under development, we restricted the design to collect respiration (breathing) data (opposed to hearth-rate or other physiological data).

The application is designed to collect breathing data; we do not perform any analysis to predict or detect sleeping disorders based on the data. However, we facilitate for future developers to utilize the data provided by Nidra to perform such task.

Finally, the implementation is Android specific as the previous work performed on the project is designed soley for Android applications. 

\section{Research Method}
The work in this thesis can be classified as \textit{computing research} with a principle approach of an \textit{engineering method} as described in \cite{Glass_1995}. The engineering method (evolutionary paradigm) is to: (i) observe existing methods, (ii) propose a better solution, (iii)  build or develop artifacts\footnote{human-manufactured objects produced during the development}, and (iv) measure and analyze until no further improvements are possible. The report identifies patterns amongst various principle approaches and categorizes the the patterns into phases: \textit{(i) informational phase}, \textit{(ii) propositional phase}, \textit{(iii) analytical phase}, and \textit{(iv) evaluation phase}. Below, we give a brief description of each phase and discuss how our work fits into each of them. 

\subsection{Informational Phase}
The informational phase according to the report is to \textit{"gather or aggregate information via reflection, literature survey, people/organization survey, or poll"}

In this thesis, we survey previous related work in the field of detecting, analyzing, and diagnosing sleep related-breathing disorders on a mobile device. A vast amount of the work, use various techniques and methods to improve the diagnosis of the disorders (e.g., using the microphone and the accelerometer in the mobile device). However, the applications are scattered around in the real-world, resulting in the patients have operate with multiple applications that are intended to do the same thing. Our intention is to create an generalized application, that reduce the development time for developers/researchers, and for patients to operate with one application for diagnosis and examination of sleep apnea. As such, we allow future developers expedite innovation in the research and study of sleep-related breathing disorders, as well as allowing patients to operate with one application. 

\subsection{Propositional Phase}
The propositional phase according to the report is to \textit{"propose and/or formulate a hypothesis, method or algorithm, model, theory, or solution"}

The solution proposition in this thesis is to create an application which will be used to record, share, and analyze breathing data collected over an extended period. We want to extend the CESAR project by providing an user-interface to the patient to perform these tasks while using the tools that the project facilitates. Mainly, we want to use the data streams dispatching tool in order to manage current and future sensor sources. In which, we proceed to add support for the Flow sensor kit. In the end, we wish to facilitate an application that is used by the patients to record their breathing data during sleep and to share the data between researchers/doctors. As such, we aid in analyzing the data to detect sleep-related breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) from home. 

\subsection{Analytical Phase}
The analytical phase according to the report is to \textit{"analyze and explore a proposition, leading to a demonstration and/or formulation of a principle or theory"}

With the proposition of this thesis, we analyze the tasks and separate them into concerns. Each concern has design choices that combined fulfills the goals of this thesis. As a demonstration, we realize the design choices by implementing them as an Android application, called Nidra. 

\subsection{Evaluation Phase}
The evaluation phase according to the report is to \textit{"evaluate a proposition or analytic finding by means of experimentation (controlled) or observation (uncontrolled, such as a case study or protocol analysis), perhaps leading to a substantiated model, principle, or theory"}

Based on the requirements and goal of this thesis, we evaluate the application by conducting experiments. Some of the experiments include participants that perform various tasks, such that we can observe the outcome of the tasks on participants without prior knowledge or experience of the application. In the end, we evaluate and conclude whether the goals and requirements of this thesis are sufficient.
