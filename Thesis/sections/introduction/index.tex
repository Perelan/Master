\section{Thesis Outline}

[Problem Statement]

How to develop an user-friendly application which facilitiates collection of physilogical data?. 

How do we create a platform (?) for third-party entities to create modules?

[Functional Requirements]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application should provide an interface for the patient to 1) record physiological signals (e.g., during sleep); 2) present the results; and 3) share the results.
    \item The application should provide an interface for the developers to create modules to enrich the data from records or extend the functionality of the application. 
    \item The application should ensure a seamless and continuous data stream, uninterrupted from sensor disconnections and human disruptions.
\end{enumerate}
