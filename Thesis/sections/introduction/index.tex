\section{Limitations}
Based on the goals and requirements stated in previous section, the scope of this thesis is to design and implement an application capable of recording breathing data obtained by the Flow sensor over an extended period. 

We limite the scope to integrating the support for the Flow sensor in Nidra, and exluded to test for already integrated sensor sources (e.g., Bitalino). Further, with the Flow sensor provided under development, we restricted the design to collect respiration (breathing) data (opposed to hearth-rate or other physiological data).

The application is designed to collect breathing data; we do not perform any analysis to predict or detect sleeping disorders based on the data. However, we facilitate for future developers to utilize the data provided by Nidra to perform such task.

Finally, the implementation is Android specific as the previous work performed on the project is designed soley for Android applications. 

\section{Research Method}
The work in this thesis is classified as \textit{computing research} with a principle approach of an \textit{engineering method} as described in \cite{Glass_1995}. The engineering method (evolutionary paradigm) is to: (i) observe existing methods, (ii) propose a better solution, (iii)  build or develop artifacts\footnote{human-manufactured objects produced during the development}, and (iv) measure and analyze until no further improvements are possible. The report identifies patterns amongst various principle approaches and categorizes the the patterns into phases: \textit{(i) informational phase}, \textit{(ii) propositional phase}, \textit{(iii) analytical phase}, and \textit{(iv) evaluation phase}. Below, we give a brief description of each phase and discuss how our work fits into each of them. 

\subsection{Informational Phase}
The informational phase according to the report is to \textit{"gather or aggregate information via reflection, literature survey, people/organization survey, or poll"}

In this thesis, we survey previous related work in the field of detecting, analyzing, and diagnosing sleep related-breathing disorders on a mobile device. Based on this, we derive that the application created in this thesis has resembelance to previous related work; however, the related-work operates different measure or instrument for solutions (e.g., using microphone and accelerometers to provide early-detection of sleep apnea). As such, we focused on creating an application that allow future developers to create modules on top of our solution (as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:nidra_modules}). By allowing this, future developers can expedite the innovation in the research and study of sleep-related breathing disorders, as well as allowing the patients to operate with one application.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Propositional Phase}
The propositional phase according to the report is to \textit{"propose and/or formulate a hypothesis, method or algorithm, model, theory, or solution"}

The solution proposition in this thesis is to create an application used to record, share, and analyze breathing data collected over an extended period. We want to extend the CESAR project by providing an user-interface to the patient to perform these tasks while using the tools that the project facilitates. Mainly, we want to use the data streams dispatching tool in order to manage current and future sensor sources. In which, we proceed to add support for the Flow sensor. In the end, we wish to facilitate an application that is used by the patients to record their breathing data during sleep and to share the data between researchers/doctors. As such, we aid in analyzing the data to detect sleep-related breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) from home. 

\subsection{Analytical Phase}
The analytical phase according to the report is to \textit{"analyze and explore a proposition, leading to a demonstration and/or formulation of a principle or theory"}

With the proposition phase of this thesis, we analyze the tasks of the application. We seperate the tasks into concerns (i.e., recording, sharing, analyzing, modules, storage, and presentation) where we propose a structure that encompasses components with functionality and design choices. With each concern combined, we drive towards the fullfing the goals of this thesis. As a demonstration, we realize the design choices by implementing them as an Android application, called Nidra. 

\subsection{Evaluation Phase}
The evaluation phase according to the report is to \textit{"evaluate a proposition or analytic finding by means of experimentation (controlled) or observation (uncontrolled, such as a case study or protocol analysis), perhaps leading to a substantiated model, principle, or theory"}

Based on the requirements and goal of this thesis, we evaluate the application by conducting experiments. Some of the experiments include participants that perform various tasks, such that we can observe the outcome of the tasks on participants without prior knowledge or experience of the application. In the end, we evaluate and conclude whether the goals and requirements of this thesis are sufficient.

\section{Thesis Outline}
The thesis is divided into three parts, which the following list presents a general overview of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Part 1: \textbf{Introduction \& Background}
    \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
        \item[Chapther 2: Background] presents the background material necessary for understanding the fundamentals in this thesis. It starts by introducing the CESAR project and the tools provided for data acquisition, as well as a description of the Flow sensor. Finally, an overview of the Android operating with the information required to understand the structure of the application (Nidra).
        \item[Chapther 3: Related Work] presents the related work focusing on creating a mobile applicaton to collect physiological data in order to diagnose sleep apnea, and with a brief
        discussion on how we contribibute with novelity and improvements from the related work.

    \item Part 2: \textbf{Design \& Implementation}

        \item[Chapther 4: Analysis and High-Level Design] presents the functional requirements of the application, the tasks derived based on the requirements and goals of the thesis, and the tasks separated into concerns, where we propose a structure of implementation which encompasses component with functionality and design choices. In the end, we discuss the data structure, namely the data entities (i.e., record, sample, module, and user), the data format (JSON versus XML), and the structure of the data packets sent from the sensor sources as well as the data packets sent on sharing. 
        \item[Chapther 5: Implementation] presents the application components of the project (i.e., Nidra, data streams dispatching module, and the Flow sensor wrapper) with the interface of IPC connectivity. Morever, it presents the steps and flow taken in order to implement the tasks based on the design choices by separting the actions and showing how the components in the application interacts.

        \item[Chapther 6: Evaluation] presents four experiements conducted in order to evalute the system requirements of the application.  Each experiement have a short description followed up by results, a discussion on improvements and findings, and conclusion of the experiement. 
        \item[Chapther 7: Conclusion] presents the summary of the thesis, followed up with contributions that answer the goals defined in the problem statement.
