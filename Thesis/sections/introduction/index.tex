\section{Limitations}
Based on the objectives and requirements defined in the previous section, the scope of this thesis is to design and implement an application capable of recording physiological obtained by the Flow sensor kit over an extended period. 

We limited the scope of testing for existing sensor source development, and the support for future sensor sources. Further, with the Flow sensor kit provided under development, we restricted the design to collect respiration (breathing) data (opposed to hearthrate).

Additionally, the implementation is Android specific as the previous work performed on the project is designed soley for Android applications. 

\section{Research Methods}

\section{Contributions}
Over the course of this thesis, we design and implemented an application for collecting, sharing and analyzing breathing data and a platform for modules to enrich the applications, called Nidra. The application is focused on creating a generalized application which manges sensor data with focus on sleep apnea / collecting data during sleep over an extended period, which purpose was to enable analyzing and sharing of the data with researchers/doctors.  

Through the work produced in this thesis, 


\section{Thesis Outline}
The thesis is divided into three parts, which the following list presents a general overview of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Part 1: \textbf{Introduction \& Background}
    \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
        \item[Chapther 2: Background] presents the background material necessary for understanding the fundamentals in this thesis. It starts by introducing the CESAR project and the tools provided for data acquisition. Then, an overview of the Android operating system architecture and components are 
        \item[Chapther 3: Related Work] presents the related work focusing on creating a mobile applicaton to collect physiological data in order to diagnose sleep apnea. Finally, we discuss why our solution is an improvement to the related work.
    \end{description}

    \item Part 2: \textbf{Design \& Implementation}
    \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
        \item[Chapther 4: Analysis and High-Level Design] encompasses the functional requirements, the design purposal, and the structure of the data in the application.
        \item[Chapther 5: Implementation] realizes the design purposal in Android, with the use of the previous work.
    \end{description}

    \item Part 3: \textbf{Evaluation \& Conclusion}
    
    \begin{description}[font=\normalfont\itshape]
        \item[Chapther 6: Evaluation] conducts various experiements in order to tests if the system requirements is fullfilling.
        \item[Chapther 7: Conclusion] discuss the objectives and the overall goal of the thesis, with suggestions to future work.
