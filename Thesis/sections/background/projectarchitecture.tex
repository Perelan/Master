\subsection{Flow Sensor Kit}
Flow is an activity sensor created by SweetZpot Inc., initially designed for measuring breathing and heart rate during activities. The sensor measures breathing per minute, in correlation to the heart rate, for optimal activity measurement. As stated on their page: \textit{"usually, at rest, your breathing varies between 6 and 8 liters per minute. During sleep, breathing can be as low as 3 liters per minute and can reach 160 liters per minute and above during high-intensity athletic activity"} \cite{flow}. Thus, this sensor could be suiting for measuring sleeping problems in the project.

The sensor is a  strap-on placed beneath the chest. It weighs 27 grams and dimensions of 77x43x17mm. Additionally, it is equipped with a 3V Lithium battery, with an estimated battery life of one year (with 7 hours a weekly usage). The sensor can be connected with BlueTooth technology, making it possible to connect with a mobile device.
