	abstract = {Serialization is a process of converting an object into a stream of data so that it can be easily transmittable over the network or can be continued in a persistent storage location. This storage location can be a physical file, database or Network Stream. This paper concludes some the work that is going on in the field of Object Serialization. This paper presents Object Serialization Techniques that can be useful for various purposes, including object serialization Minimization which can be used to decrease the size of Serialized data.},

	abstract = {In this paper we critically review task analysis models and techniques. These approaches to task analysis are discussed in order to develop a richer picture of human activity, while analyzing their limitations, general weaknesses, and possibilities for improvement. We consider their ability to determine the appropriate set of atomic actions in a task, their effect on workers’ motivational needs, their support of users’ cognitive and sociocultural processes, and their effectiveness in supporting interface design. We note that the major approaches have focused on very different levels of analysis, and call for greater integration of these different levels in task analysis theory.},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture is integrated in the very fabric of the nature of Internet. The Internet as it exists today is made up of numerous components which operate asynchronously. These independent components communicate with each other using a specific set of formats that standardize the communication and regulate the coherence of the communication. The {SOA} structure is made up of multiple loosely coupled components that can be broadly classified as service producers and service consumers. The loose coupling allows enterprises to respond to changes quickly by updating, replacing and changing concerned modules with flexibility, without affecting other components coupled to it. This paper first compares the features of the two most widely used Data Exchange formats for communication between these components and finally, provides a comparative analysis on the performance of these formats using benchmarks.},
